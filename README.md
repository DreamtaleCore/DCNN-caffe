## Introduction
This project is related to CVPR2013: [Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Sun_Deep_Convolutional_Network_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf). In this paper, it focus on the structural design of individual networks and their combining strategies.

Figure 2 is an overview of this approach. There are five facial points to be detected: left eye center (LE), right eye center (RE), nose tip (N), left mouth corner (LM), and right mouth corner (RM). The paper cascade three levels of convolutional networks to make coarse-to-fine prediction. At the first level, the paper employ three deep convolutional networks, F1, EN1, and NM1, whose input regions cover the whole face (F1), eyes and nose (EN1), nose and mouth (NM1). Each network simultaneously predicts multiple facial points. The cascade Net is constituted by 23 individual net work just as follow.
